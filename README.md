# chipsh
A chip-8 emulator written in Bash

This script was developed in Zsh, but would most likely run in Bash, Dash or a variant.

The default sh shell does not work.

Some command line tools that are required are:
- od (for reading the binary of the file)
- curl (if you want to get the random numbers from random.org)
