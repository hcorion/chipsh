# chipzsh
A chip-8 emulator written in Bash

This script was developed in Zsh, and doesn't work with bash, sh etc. (because of the differences in how arrays work.)

Some command line tools that are required are:
- od (for reading the binary of the file)

Some optional command line tools are:
- curl (if you want to get the random numbers from random.org)
